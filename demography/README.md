# Demographic analyses of Oophaga granulifera 
Bioinformatic scripts used to analyze the genomic diversification between aposematic and cryptic phenotypes of Oophaga granulifera.
The first scripts (*angsd_Saf_greens.sh*, *angsd_Saf_SAN.sh*  and *angsd_Saf_PAL.sh*) were used to infer the site frequency spectra with ANGSD
realSFS for each genetic cluster from the mappings of the RNAseq reads into O. sylvatica genome.
The other script (*stairway_plot.sh*) uses the inferred SFS of each cluster for configuring blueprint for a Stairwayplot2 analysis per cluster
