# prediction of functional impact of outlier SNPs 

The first script (*SNPdat_effect_prediction_granulifera_3consensus.sh*) was used to predict the functional effects 
of the consensus outlier SNPs (detected by three methods). To this effect the *Oophaga sylvatica* genome and annotation 
were used as reference.
The second script (*SNPdat_effect_prediction_granulifera_3consensus_SuperTransc.sh*) uses a similar approach but using the *O. granulifera* 
supertranscriptome as a reference.
